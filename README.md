# Pomodoro Timer
 This is a simple implementation of a Pomodoro Timer using React. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method where work is divided into intervals (typically 25 minutes) called "sessions" or "pomodoros", separated by short breaks (typically 5 minutes). The code consists of a functional component called App which represents the main application.

The code uses hooks provided by React, including useState and useEffect. Here's a brief overview of what the code does:

### State variables
It sets up state variables using useState hook to keep track of various values such as:
- rest (break length)
- session (session length)
- timer (current time on the timer)
- start (whether the timer is running or not)
- isResting (whether the timer is in break mode or session mode).

### Functions used
- setIncrementDecrement which is called when the user clicks on the buttons to increment or decrement break or session length. This function is responsible for either incrementing or decrementing both session and break lengths based on which button has been pressed.
- startStop which is called when the user clicks on the start/stop button to start or stop the timer
- reset which is called when the user clicks on the reset button to reset the timer and break/session to the default original lengths.

### useState hooks
There are two useState hooks. The first, depends on rest and isResting states to update the timer if the session and break variable change.

The second session, responsible for the countdown of the timer, has timer and start states as dependencies. Inside, you'd find the setTimeout for decreasing timer every second, depending if certain conditions are met.

It renders the UI components, including the timer display, buttons for start/stop and reset, and audio element for playing a sound when the timer reaches zero.


### Other
It includes some additional CSS classes for styling purposes, such as setting up the layout and appearance of the Pomodoro Timer.

It also includes a signature at the bottom of the UI to indicate the author and the date of creation of the Pomodoro Timer.

Overall, the given code implements a basic Pomodoro Timer using React with features such as setting up break and session lengths, starting/stopping the timer, resetting the timer, and playing a sound when the timer reaches zero.
